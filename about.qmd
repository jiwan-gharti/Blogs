​In my role as a Senior Backend Developer at AZminds, I spearheaded the development of a comprehensive waste management system. This platform streamlined waste tracking, reporting, and regulatory compliance, significantly enhancing operational efficiency. By integrating advanced features such as role-based access control, Google Maps API for precise navigation, and robust reporting capabilities, the system optimized waste management processes and reduced operational costs.​

Additionally, I contributed to the creation of IP Author, an AI-driven patent drafting tool designed to expedite the patent application process. Leveraging generative AI technologies, IP Author swiftly generates essential patent components, including editable flowcharts and block diagrams, streamlining the drafting process and minimizing common pitfalls. This tool has been instrumental for patent law firms, enabling them to produce comprehensive drafts efficiently.
